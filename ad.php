           <p>Working with the client we decided on <em>Aktiv Grotesk</em> font type for the headings,
             and <em>Helvetica Neue</em> for all other text on business cards and other materials. The colour
             palette was created using a combination of the clients ideas and preference and my 
             guidance and suggestions as to what would be appropriate for a carpentry business.

           <p>I created a number of different options during the logo ideation stage. The one the 
             client chose I believe has the most obvious associations with carpentry. Additionally I created some mock ups showing how the logo could look on 
             clothing for the clients uniforms (see below). The client and I were very pleased with the final deliverables.
