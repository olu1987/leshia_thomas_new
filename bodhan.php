                <p>Bodhan Consultants are in their own words - "
                a communications consultancy that helps financial companies achieve their communications goals. ".
                Before the launch of their website, I was asked to create a logo that embodied the
                the principles that they believe are at the core of their company. We were both very 
            pleased with the results and I have continued to work with them on a consulting basis.</p>
