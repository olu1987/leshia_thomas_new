              Community Logistics Solutions (CLS) are a consultancy based in Ipswich who work with Ipswich county 
              council to do logistics work and also run projects and schemes within the community. 
              The brief was for logo and business card design.

          <p>Working with the client we decided on <em>Aktiv Grotesk</em> font type for the headings,
             and <em>Helvetica Neue</em> for all other text on business cards and other materials. I created
             the colour palette using tones that I felt would look professional and clean.

             I used 3 ajacent circles as the base for the lettering in the CLS logo. Then using Adobe Illustrator i crafted
             each letter. My inspiration for using the circles as the base, was points on a map, pointing to the logistics
              nature of the business. In this same vein, but in a more obvious way, I created a map pointer that 
              is included as part of the logo and on business cards. The client was very pleased with the outcomes of our work together. 
              It was a pleasure working with CLS, and I very much believe in
              the value of the work they do within the community in Ipswich.
